                any time by clicking on the opt-out link or other unsubscribe option that is included in the respective email. We only send emails to people who have 
                authorized us to contact them, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as 
                you do. By submitting your email address, you also agree to allow us to use your email address for customer audience targeting on sites like Facebook, 
                where we display custom advertising to specific people who have opted-in to receive communications from us. Email addresses submitted only through the 
                order processing page will be used for the sole purpose of sending you information and updates pertaining to your order. If, however, you have provided 
                the same email to us through another method, we may use it for any of the purposes stated in this Policy. Note: If at any time you would like to unsubscribe 
                from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.

            <h4>Could my information be transferred to other countries?</h4>
            <p>We are incorporated in Nepal. Information collected via our website, through direct interactions with you, or from use of our help services may be 
                transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere 
                in the world, including countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such data. To the fullest extent 
                allowed by applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily consent to the trans- border transfer and hosting of such information.
            </p>
            <h4>Is the information collected through our service secure?</h4>
            <p>We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent 
                unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including 
                encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistake, or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable 
                efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect 
                your personal information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.
            </p>
            <h4>Can I update or correct my information?</h4>
            <p>The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information we collect depend on your relationship with us. Personnel may update or correct 
                their information as detailed in our internal company employment policies. Customers have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and 
                disclosures of personally identifiable information as follows. You can contact us for update or correct your personally identifiable information, change 
                your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or delete the personally identifiable information maintained 
                about you on our systems (subject to the following paragraph), by cancelling your account. Such updates, corrections, change and deletions will have no 
                effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such 
                update, correction, change or deletion. To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify 
                your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are always responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and 
                account information. You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us 
                from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a 
                non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored in d
                atabases we actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the 
                extent reasonably and technically practicable. If you are an end user and wish to update, delete, or receive any information we have about you, you may 
                do so by contacting the organization of which you are a customer.

                change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or (3) receive a record of the information we have 
                relating to you. Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we

            <h4>How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h4>
            <p>We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide service to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case 
            for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is 
            no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we'll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we 
            can't identify you.</p><h4>How Do We Protect Your Information?</h4><p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal 
            information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied

            only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems and are required to keep the information confidential. After a 
            transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot, however, ensure or 
            warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to us or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, 
            altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

                accuracy or completeness by us. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Services to another website, our Privacy Policy is no 
                longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our platform, is subject to that website's

            </p>
            <h4>Cookies for Advertising</h4>
            <p>Cookies help to make advertising more effective. Without cookies, it's really hard for an advertiser to reach its audience, or to know how many ads
